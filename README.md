# Content 
**Implementation**

Details the developed programs.

**Capability-based resource allocation ontology CAPILANO**

Provides an overview over the developed ontology and visualizes an example.

**Task allocation framework**

The steps and parts of the task allocation are detailed.

**Evaluation and results** 

An application ontology is implemented and the performance of the task allocation framework is analysed. The results of the validation are presented. 

A **video** of the evaluation scenario, implemented by the group Model-based Systems of the Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering WZL of RWTH Aachen, Chair of Production Metrology and Quality Management, Department Model-based Systems, can be found here:
